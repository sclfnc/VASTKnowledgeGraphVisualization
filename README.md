# Telescope — Zoom into your graph

A visual-analytics dashboard for the first exploration of attributed knowledge graphs.
Load a graph and get its main metrics — degree distribution, centralities, components,
type mixing, timelines — computed, visualised, and interactively explorable. No notebook,
no code.

Developed by students of the **Course on Visual Analytics** (University of Pisa) for the
**VAST Challenge 2025 – Design Challenge**. The challenge asks for a visual-analytics
design that helps non-expert users explore knowledge graphs: discover new relationships,
identify anomalies, and infer missing information.

## Quick start

```bash
./dev.sh            # backend (:8000) + frontend (:5173); Ctrl+C stops both
./dev.sh --dev      # also install test deps and run the API suite first
./dev.sh --log      # stream full pip/npm output
```

The script creates `api/venv`, installs Python and Node dependencies on first run, then
starts uvicorn and Vite. It needs a Linux shell with `bash`, `python3`, and Node
(`^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`). To start backend or frontend by hand, see the README in each
folder.

## Team

Developed collaboratively by students of the Course on Visual Analytics. Specific
contributions, from the git history:

- **Salvo Rinzivillo** — project scaffolding (Vue 3 + Vite setup, Tailwind integration,
  first layout components), the original upstream API and its test suite, the initial
  README, meeting 1 notes, and the data download script.
- **Giulia Fabiani** ([@g-fabiani4](https://github.com/g-fabiani4-unipi)) — dashboard
  rework into nested router views (Graph/Guide), responsive layout, accessibility pass,
  Graph-view panels and per-view panel filtering, dataset-view loading skeletons,
  meeting 4 notes and wireframes.
- **Francesco Secoli** ([@sclfnc](https://github.com/sclfnc)) — the Telescope reference
  implementation: the modular FastAPI backend (indices, analysis endpoints, centrality
  pipeline), the D3 panels, the filter/selection bitmap model and cross-panel contract,
  the design system, and the design documentation.
